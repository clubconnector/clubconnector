        <div class="hidden divider"></div>
        <h4 class="ui header">A. Jurisdiction of the UH Student Conduct Code</h4>
        <p>The UH Student Conduct Code shall apply to conduct that occurs on UH premises, at UH sponsored activities, in
          distance/on-line courses and events, and to off-campus conduct that affects the UH Community and/or the
          pursuit
          of its objectives. Each student shall be responsible for his/her conduct from the time of application for
          admission through the actual awarding of a degree. Conduct that occurs before classes begin or after classes
          end, as well as during the academic year and during periods between terms of actual enrollment (and even if
          his/her conduct is not discovered until after a degree is awarded), is subject to the Student Conduct Code.
          The
          Student Conduct Code shall apply to a student's conduct even if the student withdraws from school or a
          particular course while a disciplinary matter is pending. The Senior Student Affairs Officer shall decide
          whether the Student Conduct Code shall be applied to conduct occurring off campus, on a case-by-case basis, in
          his/her sole discretion.</p>

        <p>The following are examples of the types of behavior that conflict with the community standards that the UH
          values and expects of students. Engaging in, or attempting to engage in any of these behaviors subjects a

              the

          <li>
            Sexual advances, requests for sexual favors or other behavior of a sexual nature that is unwelcome and
            sufficiently severe or pervasive that it interferes with a person's academic or professional performance or

            with, or as a condition for the continued membership in, a group or organization. The express or implied
            consent of the victim will not be a defense. Apathy or acquiescence in the presence of hazing is not a

            act; both are violations of this rule.

        </ol>
        <div class="hidden divider"></div>
        <h4 class="ui header">C. Violation of Law and UH Discipline</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>UH disciplinary proceedings may be instituted against a student charged with conduct that potentially
            violates both the criminal law and this Student Conduct Code (that is, if both possible violations result
            from
            the same factual situation) without regard to the pendency of civil or criminal litigation in court or
            criminal arrest and prosecution. Proceedings under this Student Conduct Code may be carried out prior to,
            simultaneously with, or following civil or criminal proceedings off campus at the discretion of the Senior
            Student Affairs Officer. Determinations made or sanctions imposed under this Student Conduct Code shall not
            be
            subject to change because criminal charges arising out of the same facts giving rise to violation of
            University rules were dismissed, reduced, or resolved in favor of or against the criminal law defendant.
          </li>
          <li>
            When a student is charged by federal, state, or local authorities with a violation of law, the UH will not
            request or agree to special consideration for that individual because of his or her status as a student. If
            the alleged offense is also being processed under the Student Conduct Code, the UH may advise off-campus
            authorities of the existence of the Student Conduct Code and of how such matters are typically handled
            within
            the UH community. The UH will cooperate with law enforcement and other agencies in the enforcement of
            criminal
            law on campus and in the conditions imposed by criminal courts for the rehabilitation of student violators
            (provided that the conditions do not conflict with campus rules or sanctions). Individual students and other
            members of the UH community, acting in their personal capacities, remain free to interact with governmental
            representatives as they deem appropriate.
